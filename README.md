# Python Pathfinders

## Done

Currently, there are 5 path-finding algorithms in this script :

* A star
* Dijkstra
* Depth-First Search
* Breadth-First Search
* Spanning Tree Walk

## To Do

In the future, I would like to implement a bunch of pathfinding algorithms that could be interesting for future projects :

* Iterative Deeping A* (IDA*)
* Bi-directional A*
* Best-First

I could also create a Cell class that has the costs (f, h, g) attributes instead of using heavy dictionnaries that results in heavy sorting. ( hard to read ) 

Also, creating a "diagonal" mode could be interesting in terms of optimal search, since a real robot will not just move only up, down, left and right.
